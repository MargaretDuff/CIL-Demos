    "#### Phase contrast imaging\n",
    "Phase contrast imaging is commonly used in tomography as a tool to exploit the different contrast provided by absorption and phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "In absorption contrast imaging, variation in beam intensity $I$ is given by,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I  = I_0\\exp(-\\mu T),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $T$ is the material thickness and $\\mu$ is the material linear attenuation coefficient. We can also express $\\mu$ in terms of the **complex** part of the material refractive index $\\beta$ and the wavevector of the x-rays (or other probe)  $k$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu = 2k\\beta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Variation in material phase $\\phi$ is given by,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\phi = -k\\delta T,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the **real** part of the material refractive index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase contrast imaging is commonly used in samples which give poor absorption contrast, like light element materials, to resolve details which might not otherwise be resolved with absorption contrast alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Propagation-based phase contrast\n",
    "There are a number of hardware-based methods to measure phase but the simplest methods to enable phase contrast imaging are propagation-based methods. These rely on the fact that a phase shift caused by the sample results in the x-rays (or other probe) propagating differently, or refracting, which is measured as a variation in intensity at the detector after some propagation distance $\\Delta$. This causes bright fringes around edges in the sample, known as edge enhancement. There are a number of specialist lab-based CT systems that are designed to exploit propagation based phase contrast and it's also common to see phase effects in synchrotron systems with long propagation distances. These can be really helpful for highlighting features in a sample, for example for segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Phase retrieval\n",
    "However, edge-enhancement changes the intensity profile in the projections by combining the absorption and phase information. So in certain circumstances - for example where quantitative measurement of sample features is required - phase retrieval methods are used to separate these effects. This notebook uses the commonly used Paganin phase retrieval method which accounts for the change in intensity due to phase effects to retrieve the sample thickness from phase contrast images [[1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2818.2002.01010.x)]. The form of the phase retrieval additionally acts as a filter on the data, which if used with the correct physical parameters, results in a boost to the signal to noise ratio (SNR) without losing spatial resolution. Paganin phase retrieval is therefore also commonly used as a filter to boost SNR in many different contexts.\n",
